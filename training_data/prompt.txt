A Fortran code snippet provided below is a solution to a problem. Write a paragraph in three to six sentences of a PROBLEM that the code attempts to solve. It must include the explanation of the input parameters, the algorithm (if any), and returned values. The person you are writing to is fluent in Fortran, so use technical terms as necessary, but do not mention the word "Fortran" and do not use Fortran-specific terms such as subroutines. Remember, write it in the style of a LeetCode INSTRUCTION or PROBLEM that someone could follow to write the provided Fortran code, not as an explanation of what the code does. Do NOT make up anything that is not in the code. Do NOT mention copyright notices.

Here is an example output: 

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1: Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 Output: [0,1] Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2: Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6 Output: [1,2]
Example 3: Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6 Output: [0,1]

Here is another example output:

There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

Here is a different example output:
This code does not perform a meaningful action other than importing other modules.

Start with one of the following phrases:
"Given __, do/return/perform/write ___." 
"There is a ____."
